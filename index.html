      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an aspiring software  developer in the middle of a career change. I may be on the right path because as of about three weeks ago, I started dreaming in code even if I don't know all of the proper syntax or concepts yet.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>San Diego, California</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love relaxing to video games, making plastic scale models, practicing arnis/Filipino Martial Arts, and hanging out with my family.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>After having worked in higher education for years and after having spent all of those years encouraging students to change careers, my ideal job would one where I feel like I am making a difference and am actually able to see that difference after some time. This is a little vague but it makes sense to me.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>San Diego, California</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy the logic behind programming and I enjoy surfing/navigating through really well-designed websites. I'd like to be able to make that experience more accessible to other people.</p>
